This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
Mt<-read.csv("http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~stevel/Datasets/Mt1t.mutate.csv",header=TRUE,sep=',')
MT<-Mt[-c(1:3),-1]

dim(Mt)
dim(MT)
head(MT)

colSums(is.na(MT))

for(i in colnames(MT)[!(colnames(MT) %in% c("V1"))])
  set(x = MT,i = which(is.na(MT[[i]])), j = i, value = median(MT[[i]], na.rm = T))
```

```{r}
library(mclust)

scaled_mt <- scale( MT)
d <- dist(scaled_mt, method = "euclidean")
h_clust <- hclust(d, method = "ward")
plot(h_clust,labels = MT$V1)+ rect.hclust(h_clust,k=4)


```

```{r}
groups <- cutree(h_clust,k=4) 
groups
```

```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
